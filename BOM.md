# Bill of Materials

## BOM for J&D's wedding
This bill of materials is meant for a celebration with between 30 to 40 guests, and an anticipated 50-50 split between those who drink alcohol and those who don't.

The celebration was to be hosted in Poland, hence the references to products available in the Polish market as of 2022.

Modern [martini glasses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cocktail_glass) are cumbersome, and classic [Nick & Nora glasses](https://www.crateandbarrel.com/nick-and-nora-glass/s444582) may be too precious.  
A good compromise are these [IKEA wine glasses](https://www.ikea.com/pl/pl/p/foersiktigt-kieliszek-do-wina-80300207/).
