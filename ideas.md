## Customizable classics
While the [International Bartenders Association](https://iba-world.com) maintains an exhaustive list of standardized, authoritative mixed beverage recipes, many of such recipes represent variations and combination of traditional patterns/specifications: sour, highball, sling, flip...

The standard specs are useful for consistency and as a reference for drinkers and consumers, but can be intimidating for people who haven't had the change to taste multiple iterations and recognize the similarities hidden between the seemingly arbitrary names given to many of the world's best-known mixed drinks.

In an attempt to encourage people to both experiment and understand the patterns that make certain mixed drinks "work", a set of classic specs can be used as bases for a variety of accessible customizations.

The exercise will be even more accessible if the patterns are chosen so that a large number of variations can be achieved from a small set of ingredients and equipment. Last, it is adviseable to include a "reference" spec, which may correspond to an IBA recipe.

### Old-fashioned as overall reference
Recognised as the "original cocktail", defined as a mixture of spirits, water, sugar and bitters. The spirits in this case are barrel-aged grain liquor, traditionally either rye or Bourbon whiskey. As for bitters, the gentian-heavy Angostura bitters have become the standard and the most readily available.

The old fashioned is simple and accessible, and does not even require a shaker or a mixing glass: on a drinking glass, mix a small amount of sugar with a few drops of water and bitters, add ice, add whiskey. Optionally, garnish with a piece of citus peel (usually orange).

Mixing sugar with water and a favoring ingredient on the bottom of a glass is known as "muddling". Traditional recipes call for granulated sugar or sugar cubes, but powdered sugar can be used to avoid leaving undissolved sugar crystals in the drink. 

### Highballs
A highball is named after the glass in which it is served: a tall glass frequently served in train's dining cars (to avoid spillage). American high-speed trains were known as "highballs" after a particular railroad signal indicating full speed ahead.

Highball drinks have a relative high amount of non-alcoholic ingredients (the "mixer"), and variations can be made completely non-alcoholic.

- Reference spec #1: **Whiskey and Soda**. Pour a measure of *whiskey*, add ice and top with *carbonated water*.
- Reference spec #2: **Gin and Tonic**. Pour a measure of *gin*, add ice and top with *tonic water*.
- Reference spec #3: **Mojito**. Muddle fresh *mint*, sugar and *lime juice*. Pour a measure of *rum*, add ice and top with *carbonated water*.

Variations:
  - **Mint Julep**: substitute rum with *bourbon* in a Mojito. If possible, serve with crushed ice.
  - **Gin Rickey**: Pour a measure of *gin*, add the juice of half a *lime*, add ice and top with *carbonated water*.
  - **Bourbon Rickey**: Pour a measure of *bourbon*, add the juice of half a *lime*, add ice and top with *carbonated water*.

Non-alcoholic variations:
  - **Virgin mojito**: omit the rum, use brown sugar to incorporate sugarcane/molasses aroma.
  - **Juniper and tonic**: substitute gin with *smreka* (fermented juniper berry water) in a gin ad tonic.

### The Martini family
TBD. This allows customization of the levels of non-spirits, and of the effect that different garnishes can have on the drink. 

- Martinez (vermouth + bitters)
- Gin martini
- Vodka martini
- Dirty martini
- Gibson
