## Customizable classics
While the [International Bartenders Association](https://iba-world.com) maintains an exhaustive list of standardized, authoritative mixed beverage recipes, many of such recipes represent variations and combination of traditional patterns/specifications: sour, highball, sling, flip...

The standard specs are useful for consistency and as a reference for drinkers and consumers, but can be intimidating for people who haven't had the change to taste multiple iterations and recognize the similarities hidden between the seemingly arbitrary names given to many of the world's best-known mixed drinks.

In an attempt to encourage people to both experiment and understand the patterns that make certain mixed drinks "work", a set of classic specs can be used as bases for a variety of accessible customizations.

The exercise will be even more accessible if the patterns are chosen so that a large number of variations can be achieved from a small set of ingredients and equipment. Last, it is advisable to include a "reference" spec, which may correspond to an IBA recipe.

### Old-fashioned as overall reference
Recognised as the "original cocktail", defined as a mixture of spirits, water, sugar and bitters. The spirits in this case are barrel-aged grain liquor, traditionally either rye or Bourbon whiskey. As for bitters, the gentian-heavy Angostura bitters have become the standard and the most readily available.

The old fashioned is simple and accessible, and does not even require a shaker or a mixing glass: on a short tumbler (or rocks glass), mix a small amount of sugar with a few drops of water and bitters, add ice, add whiskey. Optionally, garnish with a piece of citrus peel (usually orange).

Mixing sugar with water and a favoring ingredient on the bottom of a glass is known as "muddling". Traditional recipes call for granulated sugar or sugar cubes, but powdered sugar can be used to avoid leaving undissolved sugar crystals in the drink. 

### Highballs
A highball is named after the glass in which it is served: a tall glass frequently served in train's dining cars (to avoid spillage). American high-speed trains were known as "highballs" after a particular railroad signal indicating full speed ahead.

Highball drinks have a relative high amount of non-alcoholic ingredients (the "mixer"), and variations can be made completely non-alcoholic.

- Reference spec #1: **Whiskey and Soda**. Pour a measure of *whiskey*, add ice and top with *carbonated water*.
- Reference spec #2: **Gin and Tonic**. Pour a measure of *gin*, add ice and top with *tonic water*.
- Reference spec #3: **Mojito**. Muddle fresh *mint*, sugar and *lime juice*. Pour a measure of *rum*, add ice and top with *carbonated water*.
- Reference spec #4: **Mule**. Combine *vodka* and *ginger beer*. Add *lime juice* and gently stir to involve all ingredients.

Variations:
  - **Mint Julep**: substitute rum with *bourbon* in a Mojito. If possible, serve with crushed ice.
  - **Gin Rickey**: Pour a measure of *gin*, add the juice of half a *lime*, add ice and top with *carbonated water*.
  - **Bourbon Rickey**: Pour a measure of *bourbon*, add the juice of half a *lime*, add ice and top with *carbonated water*.
  - **Rosemary fizz**: Muddle fresh rosemary, sugar and **lemon juice**. Pour a measure of **gin**, add ice, and top with tonic or carbonated water.
  - **Buck**: substitute vodka with whiskey or bourbon, add *ginger ale* and *lime juice*.  
    The Buck was the original spec for the (Moscow) mule, the vodka version became popular after World War II. 

Non-alcoholic variations:
  - **Virgin mojito**: omit the rum, use brown sugar to incorporate sugarcane/molasses aroma.
  - **Juniper and tonic**: substitute gin with *smreka* (fermented juniper berry water) in a gin ad tonic.
  - **Virgin rosemary fizz**: omit the gin.
  - **Virgin buck**: omit the spirits. Can include muddled mint.

### The Martini family
Classic and iconic.  
The Martini family allows customization of the levels of non-spirits, and of the effect that different garnishes can have on the drink. 
The drinks in this category should be served in cocktail glasses.

- **Martinez** (vermouth + bitters, citrus peel as garnish)
- **Gin martini** (olive or citrus peel as garnish)
- **Vodka martini** (olive or citrus peel as garnish)
- **Dirty martini** (adding olive brine, olive as garnish)
- **Gibson** (pickled onions as garnish)

Any of these can be made "dry" by reducing the amount of vermouth.

A non-alcoholic version can be made with Smreka and non-alcoholic white wine.
It can be "gibsonized" with an onion garnish, or made dirty with olive garnish and brine.

Related cocktail:
- **Manhattan**:  
  Substitute gin/vodka for whiskey, substitute dry vermouth for sweet red vermouth, add a few dashes of **Angostura bitters**.  
  Calling the Manhattan a member of the Martini family would be controversial, but it is certainly related in terms of proportions and technique. In a way the Manhattan stands between an Old-fashioned and a Martini: substitutes the bitters and sugar of the Old-fashioned with vermouth, and is mixed and served without ice on a cocktail glass, like a Martini.  
  The traditional garnish is a maraschino cherry, but can be substituted with an orange peel.

### The Negroni family
The Negroni is an accessible equal-portions classic that can be mixed on the very same glass it is served in.
The traditional garnish is an orange peel. These drinks should be served in short tumblers or rocks glasses.

- Reference spec: **Negroni**. Equal parts gin + red vermouth + campari. Pour over rocks on a glass and gently stir.

Variations:
- **Boulevardier**. Substitute gin with whiskey or bourbon.
- **Milano Torino**. Skip the gin, make it 50-50 Campari and red vermouth.
- **Americano**. A Milano Torino with soda water. Can be turned into a highball by adding more water and ice.
- **Negroni Sbagliato**. Substitute gin for sparkling wine.

Other things to do with extra Campari:
- **Garibaldi**. Campari and fresh orange juice. Adding a pinch of salt and shaking to aerate the juice yields the best results.
- **Campari spritz**. Campari + sparkling wine + soda water.
